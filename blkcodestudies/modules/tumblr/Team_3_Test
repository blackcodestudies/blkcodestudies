Annotations
-------------

Black man running through the woods

- "Black Skinheads" by Kanye -- creates suspense
- Very strong opening and definitely purposeful with song choice (music by John Legend)
- **Runaway slave** vs. White man and dog
- Failed escape attempt - very last second

Opening Sequence

 - Beautiful scenery of the South, somewhat eerie considering we know what happens here - brutal cruelty
 - Supplemented with spiritual singing background music
 - Field slaves vs. House slaves - picking cotton vs. tending to garden - difference in attire, appearance, work environment, etc.

More running, but for different reason (to deliver baby)

- Character: **Rosalee**, house slave, and **Rosalee's mother**
- Running again underscored with beating drums, similar to Black Skinheads
- Miracle of new life contrasted with always having to worry about slaveowner - "Miss Susannah gonna throw a fit"

**John Hawkes**

- Introduction of first white figure sympathetic to slaves
- Speaking to no one, at a heavy podium with no audience
- Equating runaway slaves to other American religiously persecuted (i.e. Puritans)
- Rock music, then silence. As no one is listening.

Post office scene

- Introduction of second white character, shown in sympathetic light - **Pullman**
- Poorer white, most likely non-slaveowner, who definitely does not live on a house like the one we saw before

Caught runaway slaves chained up by bounty hunters

- Most likely slave we saw at the beginning of the episode
- Contraption around the neck, chains, very heavy imagery of being captive
- Reference of female slave as "bitch", as if animal

Slaves in the house

- Well-dressed, very conscious of manners, young black boy eating in kitchen
- Rosalee's mother - very obedient, knows what to do

Rich white family 

- Father of house running for senate - vying for power and status
- "As if the slaves can do anything without my constant instruction" - obviously much more going on behind the scenes that white woman doesn't know about

Mr. Hawkes and Mr. Still

- Still - obviously free African-American, well-dressed
- Helps runaways - asking Hawkes to house runaway slaves
- Hawks hesitant - possibly afraid of what he has to lose?

Pullman helping escaped slave

- Seems to be very well-versed on how to help slaves escape - route, marking scent on tree/into river
- Violence against other bounty hunters - abolitionist?
- Caught runaway watching Pullman
- Rap music as background - excitement

John Hawkes home + wife

- Elizabeth Hawkes - depressed about infertility, shown destroying the house with a hammer
- Still acting as if she will have a baby 
- Both abolitionists, or at least against slavery

Escaped slaves

- Angle from eyes of escaped slave #1 - defeated, sick, hurt slaves
- Scene of absolute hopelessness
- Hope brought by other escaped slave who has the "map to freedom"
- Written out, uses own blood to etch

Killing own child

- "Can't live like this, not like this" - mother kills newborn
- Imagery of blood causes panic - common motif of blood in scenes, but all evoke very different emotions

Rosalee and her mother

- Rosalee's mother explains fear for children as a slave - happiness of having a child is overshadowed by the fear they will be sold, beaten, overworked, "too purty" (most likely referring to rape)
- Reminds me of Beloved, how she was being a protective mother
- Shows that Rosalee's mother is very obedient to protect children

Return of Noah 

- Slaveowner explaining how impossible it is to run away - take away hope
- Introduction of obedient, trusted Black - dressed well - "only takes one to spoil 'em all" - face scarred?
- Laughs at Noah's punishment of being whipped, immediately dislikable

Pullman and escaped female slave

- Abolitionist working toward improving future for son - likable and sympathetic character

Rosalee treating Noah's wounds

- Two slaves of two very different kinds - never spoken before, despite being two slaves on same plantation - very different living conditions
- "Still slaves, no matter where we sleep" - Rosalee
- "We all pretending in someway"

John and Elizabeth Hawkes on train

- Trying to have a child - unhappy sex as symbol of struggling relationship
- "It's a noble cause... but..." -- Elizabeth as a faux ally 
- "It's breaking the law" "Same law that allows people to own other people"

Noah shares the plan

- Henry, Rosalee's brother, obviously also wants to runaway to freedom

Plantation owner

- Susannah's jealousy towards Rosalee's mother? Because her own daughter obviously loves slave more
- Threatening to send her son into the fields and sell him

Noah forming a team

- Choosing people with certain skills that are trustworthy
- Cato - the obedient slave - "You think you a free man"
- Uses the term "boy" to anger Noah - "big N-word", what does it mean?

Pullman and his son

- Kind father who wants to shelter and protect his son
- Friendly with his slave? Worker?

Rosalee getting whipped

- Obviously both children's fault, but only about to whip Rosalee's brother 
- Painful scene of Rosalee getting whipped - whites don't care at all - demonstrates her previous statement "still slaves, no matter where we sleep"

John Hawkes is slaveowner's brother !!!

Funeral/Party Scene

- Party seems very modern, maybe because of music
- The obvious contrast between a tragic funeral for a child and an opulent, over-the-top birthday party for another child
- Cato also at funeral? So he is a part of the slave community??

Noah shares the plan with more people to create team

- Doubt, hesitation, among all - running away is impossible
- Father of dead baby - "all that awaits us here is death"

Elizabeth at party with Susannah

- Susannah says "All you northerners do is talk while we do all the work" when in reality she doesn't do any work, slaves do
- Shows clash between North and South in Antebellum times - interesting that Tom is a Northerner
- Shocking image of young boy fanning for the guests

Rosalee and Noah

- Inciting ideas of running away, being free

John and Elizabeth

- "This isn't the kind of world I want to bring children into, and we need to change that"
- Parallel to mother who killed newborn baby - "can't live like this"

Pullman

- Actually a bounty hunter !!!!!!!!! ???
- Tricked female runaway to get a higher bounty - audience feels betrayed

Noah's forced alliance with Cato

- Cato surprisingly also wants to be free - wants to be taken along with Noah
- Threatens to tell Tom about his escape attempt --- Noah forced into agreement
